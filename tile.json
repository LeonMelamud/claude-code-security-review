Use when asked to \"audit security\", \"review for vulnerabilities\", \"security scan\", \"check for security issues\", \"audit this PR\", \"review these changes for security\", or \"find vulnerabilities in diff\". Distinct from security-review (which provides secure coding patterns/checklists) — this skill actively audits code changes using a structured methodology with false positive filtering. Includes Python scripts for GitHub Action CI integration and PR evaluation.",
